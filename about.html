        <h1>My Personality & Passions</h1>
        <p>I believe that who we are shapes how we learn, grow, and contribute to the world. Here are a few things that define me.</p>

        <div class="traits">
            <h2>Top 3 Personality Traits / Hobbies</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Traveling (Driving):</strong> I love exploring new places, especially places with riversor a beach which helps me develop independence and patience.</li>
                <li><strong>Cars:</strong> Since owing my first car at 23 I’m fascinated by automotive technology. I plan on owing multiple cars but one in particular a BMW M5 2021. </li>

        <h2>AI Business of 2025</h2>
        <p>From the blog <em>AI Businesses of 2025</em>, my favorite idea is the <strong>AI-Powered Personal Finance Assistant</strong>.</p>

        <p>This AI helps users manage income, expenses, and savings by offering personalized insights and advice. For young professionals, this tool encourages financial discipline and helps develop smart money habits early on.</p>

        <h3>Why it’s useful to me</h3>
        <p>As someone who balances studies and needs alot of passive income-generating activities like car rentals, so i can purchace all the cars i want as such an AI would help simplify budgeting and planning for future investments or projects.</p>

        <h3>Ethical Concerns</h3>
        <p>The main issue is <strong>data privacy</strong> financial data is extremely sensitive. To ensure safety, data should be encrypted and users should clearly understand how their data is used because a lot data is being used without clear permission. Example: whenever you want to purchase something and it is mentioned out loud near a device you're using if you were to scroll on social media that said item would pop up as an ad.</p>

        <h3>Proposed Solution</h3>
        <p>Use encrypted databases, allow users to control their data sharing preferences, and make privacy policies transparent and easy to understand.</p>

        <h3>Example App</h3>
        <p>One real-world example is <a href="https://web.meetcleo.com" target="_blank">Cleo</a>, an AI-based budgeting assistant that offers spending insights and financial coaching.</p>
